# Student-Grade-Project

A program that I wrote for my C++ class. 
First, it asks for a number of students. 
Then, according to the number that was entered, it asks for a grade of each student. 
The program organizes the grades and prints the final result, which displays the number of students for each grade category. 
There is also input validation implemented.
